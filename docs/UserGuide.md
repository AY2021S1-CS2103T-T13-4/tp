## 6.1 General Inquiry
This section features general questions about _Common Cents_ that are not specific to the features.

2. **Question:** Where can I make bug reports?<br>
**Answer:** You may submit a bug report directly to our team [here].



## 6.2 Features Inquiry
This section features feature-related questions about _Common Cents_.
1. **Question:** What happens if I forget my account names?<br>
**Answer:** You may use the `listacc` command to see a full list of your existing accounts.

2. **Question:** I encountered this situation when using the features as shown in the screenshot below. I understand that the 
prefix indicated is wrong after checking the `add` section in the User Guide. However, the error message states that my category is
wrong. Can I clarify on this situation?<br>
*(Insert screenshot for the case "edit 2 c/expense n/buy McSpicy a/8.60")*

   **Answer:** 
Yes, the prefix indicated is wrong as it should be `d/` instead of `n/`. As a result, the category parameter is read as
`expense n/buy McSpicy a/8.60` instead of `expense`. Do remember to check that the **prefixes and parameters required for a command
are correct!** If you are unsure of the prefixes and parameters required, do check the sections under features above!
